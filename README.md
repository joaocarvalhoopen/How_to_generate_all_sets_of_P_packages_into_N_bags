# How to generate all sets of P packages into N bags
Santa Claus has to optimize the space for everyone present on the sled

## Description
Santa Claus got him self a a quantum computer, but the computer is still being designed by a big tech Open Source and Open Hardware company (it's a donation to the common good for 2022). So Santa asked a bunch of developers to make small pieces of code to help him Optimize the placement of all presents in the sled bags. The algorithm that was attributed to me was a simple one: <br>

* Generate all sets of P packages into N bags

Others will have to do other parts of the all Christmas software to make, already preparing for the christmas of 2022 ... <br>
This is a nice way to start the new year, looking and developing some code for Santa Claus. <br>

## How does it work?

Well, we will do a backtracking algorithm with recurrence. In it we will transverse the stack, implicitly drawing a tree that at each node as a state for each configuration. We will be making changes to the state has we go down the tree and we will undo does changes has we go up the tree. In the first node we will put all the presents in the first bag and then we will shift the presents between bags (from left to right) into all places, into all combinations as we travel the tree. At each node we test the constrains and collect the new presents in bag configuration.   

```
Tree

                                    (A,B,C:_:_)
                     ____________________||____________________
                 (A,B:C:_)                                 (A,B:_:C)
           __________||__________                    __________||__________
       (A:B,C:_)             (A:C:B)              (A:B:C)            (A:_:B,C)
      _____||_____         _____||_____         _____||_____        _____||_____
(_:A,B,C:_) (_:B,C:A)  (_:A,C:B) (_:C:A,B)  (_:A,B:C) (_:B:A,C)  (_:A:B,C) (_:_:A,B,C)
```

## How many states are there?

```
               Max P
               -----
               \             p 
 Num states =   |     (b - 1)
               /
               -----
                p=0


 Where:
    "Max P" is the number of Presents or Packages.
    b is the number of Bags in the Sled.
